计算机体系结构会惩罚每个本科没好好学C的学生 ：）

- Check that DOT pdf file to grade the source code.
- Don't use my code directly for your project if you are taking this class.

- For the random number generator, please adapt the code to your own project. 
  - Different random number generators may have different properties.

- I include the libsodium library in the project to generate numbers. The newest version of libsodium is compiled under Linux(RHEL). If you want to run it on Mac, please

```sh
cd src/lib/libsodium-1.0.18
make clean
make && make install
```
